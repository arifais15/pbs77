- Background color: '#E0E8EF' (very light blue) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that complements the primary color without causing distraction.
- Accent color: '#346E99' (a slightly brighter and more saturated blue) to highlight interactive elements and important information; to draw the user's attention, and provide good contrast
- Body and headline font: 'SolaimanLipi' (sans-serif) for readability, particularly with the Bengali language content.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Simple, professional icons for indicating different types of actions or categories within the interface.
- A clean, form-based layout for easy data entry, combined with a clearly structured letter preview.
